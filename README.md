# Piconot

## Overview

This assignment asks you to re-design the syntax of an existing language
(Picobot) and to implement your syntax as an internal DSL. The goals of
this assignment are to: (a) learn how to design a brand-new syntax, (b) get
practice formally specifying the syntax of a language, and (c) get some
experience implementing a language the **wrong way**. You'll probably design a
syntax that is either difficult to implement internally or that is so different
from the semantics of the language that it requires significant implementation
effort on your part. **This is good!** It's good to have a chance to experience 
the limitations of internal DSLs, so you'll start to develop an instinct
for when they are and are not appropriate. It's also good to have a chance to
experience how different a language's syntax can be from its semantics.

In short: get in there and play. Push internal DSLs to the limit! 

## Checklist
  - [ ] [Sign up for teams][Teams]. Team 1 will have three people; all other 
    teams will have two people
  - [ ] Formally specify the syntax for the original version of Picobot in 
    `grammar-orig.txt`
  - [ ] Design a new syntax for Picobot 
     - [ ] Describe your design in `design.txt`
     - [ ] Before you implement the syntax, formally specify it in 
       `grammar-ideal.txt`
  - [ ] Implement your new syntax
     - [ ] Add files, as needed, to implement your syntax
     - Include two example programs
       - [ ] `src/main/scala/piconot/Empty.scala`
       - [ ] `src/main/scala/piconot/RightHand.scala`
     - [ ] Describe your implementation process in `evaluation.txt`
     - [ ] Formally specify your final syntax in `grammar-final.txt`

## Warm-up: Formal syntax
Formally specify the syntax for [Picobot, as it's defined in CS 5][Picobot]. 
Place your definition in `grammar-orig.txt`. 
You must use [Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)][EBNF] to specify the grammar.

## Syntax design
Design your own syntax for Picobot. Try to come up with a design that is
faithful to the domain (of maze-navigation), that does not add any new features
(e.g., non-determinism), but that is also not restricted to students in CS 5.
The more novel your syntax, the better, assuming that it's faithful to the
domain. **Design your syntax as an ideal, i.e., don't worry at all about how you'll
implement it.**

**Note:** If you're in a group of three, you should come up with *two* designs. You
must describe and justify both designs, but you need to implement only one of
them.

Formally specify the syntax for your design, using EBNF. Place your definition
in the file `grammar-ideal.txt`. 

Describe and justify your design, in the file `design.txt` (see that file for
instructions on what to write). **Note:** If you're in a group of three,
describe both designs.

## Syntax implementation
Implement the syntax you designed, as an internal DSL in Scala. To do so, you'll
want to consider how you'll connect your syntax to the semantics of Picobot and 
how to organize your code. You'll also need to include a couple of sample
programs and keep a running "diary" of your work. 

### Picobot semantics

I've provided a library that implements the semantics of Picobot. you'll need to
transform statements from your internal language into calls to the provided
library.

You'll need to understand the interface for the Picobot library (but not its
implementation!). You should take a look at the file
`src/main/scala/piconot/EmptyAPI.scala` for an example use of the library. You
can also look at the library's [auto-generated documentation][API]. The code for
the library itself is in the `lib` directory. Thanks to sbt, you shouldn't need
to do anything special with the library to build and run your code.

#### Building and running your code

You should be able to load the code into ScalaIDE in the usual way (i.e., by
executing `sbt eclipse` in the top-level directory).

You can also run the program on the command line, by typing `sbt run` in the top
-level directory. (Note, if you run the program from the command line, you'll
probably get a warning about a .css file, and the graphics for the buttons will
look a bit different. The program should still work, though.) If you use sbt and
the provided `build.sbt` file to build your code, you should  automatically have
access to the Picobot library, and it will be included on your classpath when
you compile and run.

### Organizing your code
You can and should add any files you need, to implement your language.

### Example programs
Include at least two sample programs: 

  1. `src/main/scala/piconot/Empty.scala`: a program in your internal DSL that 
  can solve the empty maze. A file that describes an empty maze is in 
  `resources/empty.txt`.
  
  2. `src/main/scala/piconot/RightHand.scala`: a program in your internal DSL 
  that uses the right-hand rule to solve the maze in `resources/maze.txt`.

## A running diary
As you work, comment on your experience in the file `evaluation.txt`. In
particular, each time you change your ideal syntax, you should describe what
changed and why you made the change (e.g., your original idea was too hard to
implement or it didn't match well with the library calls) You should also answer
the following questions: On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is "a lot"), how much did
you have to change your syntax? On a scale of 1–10 (where 10 is "very
difficult"), how difficult was it to map your syntax to the semantics?

### Formalize your final syntax
After you've finished implementing, formally specify the syntax of your internal
DSL in `grammar-actual.txt`
